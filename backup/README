=== The backup directory

This file gives a brief description of the contents in the backup directory

Backup player files are ASCII text files organized in separate directories.
The average player file is 10K long.  You may compress the playerfiles
using 'gzip -9 -r *' in the player directory periodically.  This keeps
player files erased with the immortal "delete" command. So the most likely is
you will want to erase them... They do take space you know!
